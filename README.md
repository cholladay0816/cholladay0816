# Hello, welcome to my GitHub!
My name is Chris and I'm a self-taught developer from Missouri.  I like to learn new things, build incredible programs, refactor them again, and play Quake.

## Current Projects
### AmericanDadSpeedruns.com
  A fun side project that hosts the fastest American Dad Speedruns anywhere on the net.  This project started as a funny idea written in vanilla PHP and has been rebuilt from the ground up with Laravel and Tailwind.  The project is done but I keep up with maintaining security updates, fixing bugs, and verifying new entries.
### CreatorCore
  A commission-based web platform for commissioning and selling digital art.  This site has gone through many iterations (and was completed in base php at one point), but has been converted into Laravel, then re-converted using Vue, then re-converted using Livewire.  Now it's being redesigned using Test Driven Development.  Hopefully I'll make it all the way this time.  If not, I'll see you in the [Testing branch](https://github.com/cholladay0816/CreatorCore/tree/Testing).
